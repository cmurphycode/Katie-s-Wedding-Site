<p>Katie and Joe's wedding party:</p>

            <h4>Katie and Jena (Maid of Honor)</h4>
            <p>Moments after turning in the form at Summer Gateways Orientation, Katie asked me
if we should live together at Holy Cross. So began our long history of feeling out of
place mostly everywhere together, and laughing at it. Even though no one loves the
story like we do, we changed the definition of "random roommates" forever. I'm so
happy for her and Joe.</p>

            <img class="moh" title="Katie and Jena" src="pics/party/italydinnercaroline.jpg"></img>
            <h4>Katie and Caroline</h4>
            <p>The first thing Joe told me about Katie was that she had the exact same name as
my sister. Already confused, Joe then told me that she was a model. At this point

I was in complete disbelief and thought that he had google imaged a fake girl. I
finally believed Joe when I met Katie at one of our weekly family parties. Katie and
I became close sharing our passions for sugary treats, hand bags,ipads, boots, and
puppies. Katie and Joe visited me in Italy for a week and we once again bonded over
our love of food. I am so happy for them both and cannot wait until July 2012!!!</p>

            <h4>Katie and Leslie</h4>
            <p>Our 16 year friendship began on Bus #2 in 4th grade, and was solidified at
Katie's "The Price is Right" party later that year. We've been there for each other
through awkward middle- and high-school years, college, and into the real world,
and now I'm so thrilled to be there for her on her wedding day to Joe, the only man
who could ever be her equal on the dance floor.</p>

            <h4>Katie and Kristen Fleming</h4>
            <p>We met on the DS elementary school softball team where we did cartwheels in the
outfield. Our friendship was solidified for the ages when a certain 'Rumors' video
went viral. I'm so proud to be a part of your special day, and promise not to wear a
unitard.</p>

            <h4>Katie and Liz</h4>
			<p> We met freshman year of college in Mulledy dorm and instantly bonded
over our love for reality TV (shout out to Jeff Lewis and Zoila!)
We've shared so many memories together and I cannot wait for your
special day to create one more! I'm excited to be part of the wedding and
I know it will be a beautiful occasion. I only wish you and Joe the
best things in life- congrats and cheers!</p>

            <h4>Katie and Cassie</h4>
            <p>Katie and I met while being residents of the great Mulledy 3 East freshman
year. Our bond became unbreakable when we realized our mutual fondness
of N.E.R.D.'s "Lapdance" and all forms of carbohydrates. I was there from the
beginning of the Murphy/Murphy relationship in Philosophy 101 with May Sim, and
encouraged Joe to poke Katie on Facebook to show that he had a crush on her. I am
also proud to say that I was third wheel on Katie and Joe's first "date" in Mulledy
Basement. Katie and Joe have come a long way from their Mulledy dates, and I can't
wait to celebrate their wedding next July!</p>

            <h4>Katie and Caitlin</h4>
            <p>I met Katie on what I think was her 19th birthday. Joe brought her to Stars, the fine
American gastropub that I worked at the time, for a lovely meal before going to see
Dane Cook. I remember being a surly witch because my loser boyfriends were never
that thoughtful for date nights and the restaurant was slammed with other vivacious
couples who wanted burgers before going to see the funniest man of 2005. When
Joe told me that she was voted prettiest girl in the Holy Cross freshman facebook
per a survery of guys in Wheeler, I immediately concurred.</p>

            <h4>Katie and Kristen Raymond</h4>
            <p>Although an exact date is hard to pin down, our friendship likely began in our
suave days as sixth graders at DSMS. Our shared fondness for all things weird
allowed us to entertain ourselves not only through the middle school years (aka Ms.
Pudelka's Speech and Presentation class) but also to the present (aka impromptu
photoshoots on the Cape). Heading now into year XIV of our friendship, you are the
only person with whom I've traveled with to see James Taylor in concert AND filmed
a homemade infomercial with ("The Bag" will be bigger than Snuggie/Slanket one
day). I am so happy to still be your friend and wish you and Joe nothing but the best!</p>

            <h4>Katie and Bridget</h4>
            <p>I knew that Katie and I would be lifelong friends after witnessing her stellar dance
moves at a party freshman year. Together, with my American Idol worthy vocals,
Katie and I danced and sang our way through Holy Cross. I am so excited to be a
part of Joe & Katie's wedding (and can't wait to celebrate on the dancefloor)!</p>

            <h4>Joe and Dan</h4>
			<p>My first one-on-one encounter with Joe was when I was getting a room
ready for Colins arrival. As the nice guy that Joe is, he humbly offered
to help with the project. At that point I was thinking wow I got a pretty
cool brother-in-law. so I said "sure Joe, you can help by painting those
doors." Well needless to say, within 5 minutes he found something better
to do. Its the thought that counts I guess (except when you have to paint
10 doors all by yourself).</p>

            <h4>Joe and Chris</h4>
			<p>My first experience with Joe was taking pictures of him hanging out with Katie and KFlem in the ocean, wearing Katie's hot pink inflatable dragon tube around his waist. At first, I thought "Wow, what a hipster", but I soon learned he was just afraid of sharks. Since then, I've tried to be the intimidating brother-in-law, but it's been difficult to accomplish due to Broseph's superior bench press and speed bag skills.

			<p> Tim and Joe met at BC High during their freshman year. He is still
receiving treatment for the mental anguish that Joe's ugly mug has inflicted
on his life. Tim currently works in Providence, RI in the Governor's office.</p>

            <h4>Joe and Barker</h4>
			<p>Joe and Barker wuv kitties, tomato sams, and chocolate milk. They have
been known to laugh at fart jokes, fight over the Megatron voice helmet,
and drink black and tans. They spent two whole years living in close
proximity while attending Holy Cross. But it didn't take either one very long
to realize that they had found kindred spirits in each other: they both had
the maturity of a 13 year old Thai boy.</p>
